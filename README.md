# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I would like to inform you that my friend, Om Kumar, encountered an issue with his GitHub account, which was temporarily suspended. As a result, he was unable to use his own account to submit the project. To ensure the project was submitted on time, he used my GitHub account for this purpose. Please note that the project itself is entirely his work, and this was a temporary arrangement due to the suspension of his account.

Thank you for your understanding.
